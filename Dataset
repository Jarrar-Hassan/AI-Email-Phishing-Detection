Dataset

The Machine Learning models (phishing_model.pkl and tfidf_vectorizer.pkl) included in this project were trained on a curated email dataset. You do not need to download or provide a dataset to use the application, as the models are already trained and ready for inference.

If you wish to retrain the models or improve them, you can use any suitable email dataset containing labeled phishing and safe emails.
